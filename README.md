# riskFDA

riskFDA is a risk-based web application that utilizes precise data analytics and descriptive spatial mapping to improve public safety in drug manufacturing.

## Description

Due to lack of resources in the form of manpower and money, the FDA is not able to conduct sufficient inspections on all drug manufacturing companies.  With recalls, adverse events, and risk data gathered from the FDA's database and the FDA API, we have created a predictive tool that classifies facilities with higher risk based on their history.  Based on this, FDA inspectors can have a better idea of which facilities should be inspected next.
